# Heads up!<br>
I was developing and adjusting this plugin on my spare time, but my life changed a lot and I'm currently unable to provide new updates and help the community. 
I'm still using it on my OctoPrint setup, and it's still working, so if you want to try it, fell free.<br><br>

For those looking for a better option to automate your printer using a Tuya device I strongly recommend getting a new Pi or an old PC, setup Home Assistant and create an automation to detect when  your printer finishes to turn off the Tuya Outlet and vice-versa.
Home Assistant can fully integrate natively with Octoprint and Tuya and be able to access a ton of infos front Octoprint out of the box like printer status, print time, temps and list go on. 
Home Assistant is very easy to setup, and this integrations are completely hassle free, far more easy than tweaking with Tuya cloud, API Keys that are needed for this plugin.

# OctoTuya-SmartPlug
With this plugin you'll be able to control [Tuya-based](https://en.tuya.com/) SmartPlugs either directly from Octoprint Web interface or through GCODE commands<br>

Work based on [OctoPrint-TuyaSmartplug](https://github.com/ziirish/OctoPrint-TuyaSmartplug). <br>
The original plugin by [ziirish](https://github.com/ziirish) was a must have to my 3D printing setup since my printer is connect to a Tuya smart outlet.<br>
But after going to the whole process of finding the required information to use the plugin I found out that it was not working properly and its been a couple of months since it was not updated, therefore forking the original repository and opening a Pull Request wasn't the best option.<br>
So I decide to look into its code and work the problems that I found, adding some changes to improve his work and a nice Wiki to guide users to the process of using it.<br>
This version of the plugin uses the tinytuya API to do the communications instead of the pytuya API. The tinytuya proved in my tests to be more reliable in terms of keeping comunication stable with the device and be more compatible as well.

## Disclaimer

Tuya is by far the most difficult IoT plataform that can be used to control devices by third-part software like this plugin, they require very specific information on the devices and change often their IoT Cloud Service.<br>
Many user have given up on using Tuya devices with OctoPrint because of its difficulty, some changed to other brands, other dug deeper and changed the device firmware or completely changed the device microcontroler, literally soldering a new one.<br>
If you, like me, only have Tuya devices and doesn't feel confortable on doing firmware flashes or resoldering, this plugin has a place on your OctoPrint instalation and its worth of your time configuring it. <br><br>
This plugin still needs improvements on the code itself, UI, performance and other elements, so you are more then welcome to open [PullRequests](https://github.com/andrelucca/OctoTuya-SmartPlug/pulls) with code updates/fixes or [Issues](https://github.com/andrelucca/OctoTuya-SmartPlug/issues) regarding what needs to be fixed. <br>
This is of course a side project of mine that unites two subjects that I like, so if you open a PR, Issue or a Discussion topic I'll answer as soon as I can, don't be angry if it takes more time than you think it should :). 

## How it was tested?

I tested all the plugin features using my Ender 3 V2 (Using original Marlin as Firmware that I configured and compiled) connected to the Octoprint v1.8.7. The Raspberry of my Octoprint is connected on the PSU of the printer, so if I power of the printer using the Tuya outlet it will also power-off the Raspberry (and will do it unsafely if I hadn't shutdown the Pi OS properly).

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/dpradeepraja/OctoTuya-SmartPlug-3.5-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

## Preparatory Work

All Tuya devices requires 2 infos in order to be controled by other software: `Device ID` and `Local Key`<br>
And this is were the greater difficulty takes place. I made a full guide on how obtain this info in this project [Wiki](https://github.com/andrelucca/OctoTuya-SmartPlug/wiki) so make sure you follow it and have this infos before installing an using this plugin.

## Configuration and Settings

All details on how to configure the plugin and how to change its settings according to your liking are in this project [Wiki](https://github.com/andrelucca/OctoTuya-SmartPlug/wiki)

## Support jneilliii and ziirish Efforts
Most of the code used in this plugin has been written by
[jneilliii](https://github.com/jneilliii) and its general idea came from [ziirish](https://github.com/ziirish) so if you want to support someone,
you can support their work.
